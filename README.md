**Step 2: Connect to Your Linode Server**
1. Use SSH to connect to your Linode server using the terminal:
   ```
   ssh username@your_server_ip
   ```

**Step 3: Update and Upgrade**
1. Update the package list and upgrade existing packages:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

**Step 4: Install LAMP Stack**

   ```
   sudo apt install apache2 mysql-server php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql php-gd php-ldap php-curl php-xml php-mbstring
   ```

**Step 5: Configure MySQL**
1. Secure your MySQL installation:
   ```
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
   ```
2. Create a MySQL database and user for GLPI:
   ```
   mysql -u root -p
   CREATE DATABASE glpi;
   CREATE USER 'glpiuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON glpi.* TO 'glpiuser'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   EXIT;
   ```

**Step 6: Download and Install GLPI**

   ```
   wget https://github.com/glpi-project/glpi/releases/download/9.5.6/glpi-9.5.6.tgz
   ```
2. Extract the downloaded file:
   ```
   tar -xvzf glpi-9.5.6.tgz -C /var/www/html/
   ```

**Step 7: Configure Apache**
1. Create a virtual host configuration for GLPI:
   ```
   sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/glpi.conf
   ```
   Add the following content:
   ```
   <VirtualHost *:80>
       DocumentRoot /var/www/html/glpi
       ServerName your_server_ip
       <Directory /var/www/html/glpi>
           Options FollowSymLinks
           AllowOverride All
           Require all granted
       </Directory>
       ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
       CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
   </VirtualHost>
   ```
2. Enable the virtual host and Apache modules:
   ```
   sudo a2ensite glpi.conf
   sudo a2enmod rewrite
   ```
3. Restart Apache:
   ```
   sudo systemctl restart apache2
   ```

**Step 8: Complete Installation via Browser**

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the GLPI installation process.
3. During installation, provide the MySQL database details (database name, user, and password) that you set up earlier.

**Step 9: Secure Your Installation**
1. After installation, remove the install directory for security purposes:
   ```
   sudo rm -rf /var/www/html/glpi/install/
   ```

**Step 10: Access GLPI**
1. You can access GLPI by navigating to `http://your_server_ip` in your web browser.
